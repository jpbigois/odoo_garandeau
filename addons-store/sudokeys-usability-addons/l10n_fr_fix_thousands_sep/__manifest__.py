L10n FR Fix Thousands Separator
===============================

Make sure that the language fr_FR is installed **before** installing this module.

By default, the French language (fr_FR) has space as *Thousands Separator* and the *Separator Format* is not set. If you manually set a good value for *Separator Format* ([3,0]) and you keep space as *Thousands Separator*, you will get the following problem: when you display a float with a value over one thousand and there isn't enough horizontal space in the tree or form view, the number will be displayed over 2 lines (or more). This often happens in *Accounting > Journal Entries > Journal Items* for users that don't have super-wide screens. And it is a cause of headache for accountants ! :)

When you install this module:

* on language with code *fr_FR*, the Thousands Separator* will be set to the unicode caracter U+202F *NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE* (http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/202f/index.htm) and the *Separator Format* will be set to [3,0].

* on language with code *en_US* (installed by default), the *Separator Format* will be set to [3,0].
